I consider myself as a high potential learner, my passion is to know and to gain everything about programming languages, using this passion as a skill in my life allows me to reach several achievements, and to be in some sort of good problems solver mentality.
My background diplomas are remarkable for some in my age, as a web developer and fully qualified logistics and optimisation engineer additional to many years experience in different tasks as projects creator and qualified developer, in both sides 
And let me add one point, i have a good three years electrical engineering diploma.
